#### Design Tool (Bootstrap vs. Material-UI)
- Deciding on which design tool to use: Bootstrap vs. Material-UI
- - Material-UI vs Bootstrap: A Detailed Comparison ([UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/material-ui-vs-bootstrap-a-detailed-comparison-8fc9151db5ed)) ([Infographic](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Hrk9TH0yeTiVKjMA.png))
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  - CSS/HTML/JS framework
  - built by Twitter
  - e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Apple Music, Twitter, Coursera
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - React UI framework
  - built by an unnamed team
  - e.g. Nasa, Amazon, Unity, Google, JPMorgan
- While I am drawn to Material-UI for its Material Design (Google), I am drawn to React Bootstrap for its higher design consistency in UX and interface
  - With this advantage, I expect to be able to focus more on developing content and features
  - Speed is important for the limited time we are afforded in our MVP project

# Blue Ocean Notes

## State Management
- small app: hooks
- medium app: context
- large app: redux

London Buchanan, Stuart
- manage large scale events
- coachella
- large sporting events
- london buchanan manages the marketing

Stuart from Australia

## Background
- Event management company
  - many different scale events
  - create branding campaigns
  - has trouble sorting through photos for each event
  - 1000s of photos
  - need a photo finder
  - need to be able to filter through photos that meet certain criteria
  - app will automatically assign tags to the photos
  - "hey circle find me a photo of me holding a dog"
  - goal is to be able to have this tool, so that they can achieve better market *value*?
  - 100s, possibly 1000s, of photos
  - can sort them in the fastest way possible

## Criteria
- clothing
- food
- beverages
- certain landscape
- what's going on in the background

## Goals
- They currently have a website
- They want to be able to access on a mobile device
- Photos uploaded could be users, event organizers,
- Anybody at the event can access & download these photos
- sort by
  - events
  - users
  - users can share with each other
  - friend system
- turn key platform
  - here's this application
  - take photos from within app
  - hey Siri, find me a photo of "a person wearing a red shirt and drinking a beer"
  - users can add tags to the photos
  - use in web browser and photos
  - users have access to their own photos
  - users can share their photos with their friends
- admins can access all photos
- brand colors: yellow, purple
  - market towards millenial customers
- company name: LeadEvents
- name of app: open to us
- needs a login for each user
- budget for servers: as low as possible
- expectation: should grow as company grows
- scalable
- when not logged in: users should see stock photos, general marketing, event photos
- should be able to share photos with other users, not necessarily a like feature
- JOSH nice haves:
  - when user logs in, be able to upload all the photos and sort them automatically

- user info
  - name
  - phone
  - email address


## Constraints
- develop API in-house
  - minimize use of external APIs

## Prioritization
- users can sort through photos, and add tags
  - nice to have, software will auto tag photos




1. MVP
   1. photo gallery
   2. user system
   3.
2. stretch goals
   - auto-tagging = stretch (Josh)
