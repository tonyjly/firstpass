#### Design Tool (Bootstrap vs. Material-UI)
- Deciding on which design tool to use: Bootstrap vs. Material-UI
- - Material-UI vs Bootstrap: A Detailed Comparison ([UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/material-ui-vs-bootstrap-a-detailed-comparison-8fc9151db5ed)) ([Infographic](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Hrk9TH0yeTiVKjMA.png))
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  - CSS/HTML/JS framework
  - built by Twitter
  - e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Apple Music, Twitter, Coursera
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - React UI framework
  - built by an unnamed team
  - e.g. Nasa, Amazon, Unity, Google, JPMorgan
- While I am drawn to Material-UI for its Material Design (Google), I am drawn to React Bootstrap for its higher design consistency in UX and interface
  - With this advantage, I expect to be able to focus more on developing content and features
  - Speed is important for the limited time we are afforded in our MVP project
